Abstract
---------
Indoor target detection through motion sensing based on Wi-Fi signals has gained much attention recently. However, most of the existing motion detection approaches can only detect motion in a large coverage area without knowing the distance of the target motion from the transmitter (Tx)/receiver (Rx). Passive positioning techniques can provide the location of a target, which, however, requires high deployment efforts without robust performance. In this paper, we present a novel technique for detecting motion in proximity by exploring the physics behind the indoor radio frequency (RF) multipath propagation. We discover that motion in the proximity of the Rx/Tx produces distinct time dispersion over the radio channel at the Rx/Tx side. By exploring two novel metrics and linking them with the distance of the motions to antennas, we are able to precisely distinguish motions in nearby proximity from the motions far away. Extensive experiments in various real-world scenarios demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve true positive rates (TPR) greater than 95% and 99% in distance-based and room-level proximity detection, respectively, while maintaining the corresponding false positive rates (FPR) less than 5% and 0.5%. The detection delays for a detection distance of 2 m are within 0.6 s, which verifies the responsiveness of the proposed scheme.
